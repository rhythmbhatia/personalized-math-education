# Personalized Math Education Toolkit 🧠📐

This project uses Google’s open-source models (TensorFlow, BERT, T5) and math libraries like SymPy to provide a prototype for adaptive, personalized learning in math.

## Features
- Predicts learning mastery using student behavior data.
- Understands natural language math queries with BERT.
- Generates math problems using T5.
- Evaluates math step-by-step using SymPy.
- Supports gesture input with MediaPipe (optional).

## To Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/demo_notebook.ipynb
